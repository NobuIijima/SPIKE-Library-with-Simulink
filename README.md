## Overview

**Simulink LEGO SPIKE Library** is an extension library designed to intuitively control LEGO SPIKE Prime within Simulink. It enables users to visually construct complex control logic, making it ideal for educational settings and robotics development.

By combining Simulink’s block-based modeling environment with LEGO’s flexible hardware, users can achieve advanced robot control without needing programming expertise.

## Features

- Includes a wide range of custom blocks specifically for LEGO SPIKE Prime  
- Real-time interaction with sensors and motors  
- Leverages Simulink’s simulation capabilities for behavior verification  
- Suitable for both educational use and rapid prototyping  

## Use Cases

This library is ideal not only as a robotics teaching tool in STEM education but also for research and prototyping new ideas.

For example, students can design robots as part of a class project and build control logic in Simulink while simulating their behavior. Dynamic control based on sensor input and complex coordinated motor actions can be easily implemented by combining blocks.

## A Tool to Inspire Creativity

Simulink LEGO SPIKE Library is more than just a control tool—it’s a platform that sparks creativity. From children to adults, anyone can bring their ideas to life. This library serves as a powerful tool to nurture the next generation of engineers and inventors.
